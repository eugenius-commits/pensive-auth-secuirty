# Auth Security Module

The Auth Security Module is a Spring Boot application designed to provide authentication and security features for user management in a web application.

## Goals

The main goals of this module are:

1. **User Authentication**: Enable users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.

2. **Role-based Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage users' access to resources based on their roles.

3. **Secure Password Storage**: Ensure secure storage of user passwords using encryption techniques.

4. **Database Interaction**: Provide seamless integration with a PostgreSQL database for storing user data.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality.
- Role management for defining user roles and permissions.
- Password hashing and salting for secure password storage.
- RESTful API endpoints for user management operations.
- Integration with Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization.
- Database schema generation and management using Spring Data JPA.
